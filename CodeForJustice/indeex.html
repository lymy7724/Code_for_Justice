    <p id="education-paragraph">Education is crucial for migrants for a variety of reasons. One of the main problems that migrants face is discrimination and exclusion in their new host country. This can lead to limited access to job opportunities, social services, and even basic rights. By obtaining an education, migrants can gain important skills and knowledge that can help them navigate and succeed in their new environment. Our mission at Rebel Resources is to connect migrants to those necessary resources.</p>

    <p>A challenge that migrants often face is language barriers.Without the ability to communicate effectively in their new language, migrants may struggle to find employment, access healthcare, we work with organizations such as <a href="https://www.ilctr.org/programs/">The Immigrant Learning Center</a> which is devoted to helping migrants overcome the language barrier free of charge.</p>
